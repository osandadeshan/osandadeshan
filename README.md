* **MaxSoft GReporter**
  * In testing perspective, the test execution report is a vital document where the stakeholders can get an idea of the project health.
  * Gauge is proving a detailed test execution report with all the error messages and the screenshots incorporated to the failing steps.
  * But anyhow we should manually send the test execution report to the stakeholders by mentioning the number of scenarios executed, passed count, failed count and skipped count. Also in a regression cycle, we have to send those counts as module wise figures. Further we are embedding pie charts and bar charts to that report to represents the test execution data in a high readable manner.
  * Here I have given an automated solution for this issue by developing a Java plugin for gauge to send the test execution summary to a defined audience.
